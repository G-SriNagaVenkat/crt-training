JavaScript is a scripting language. JavaScript is loosely coupled.

Applications of JavaScript:
  - Mobile applications
  - Gaming applications
  - Server-side applications
  - Web applications

Variables:
  - Variables are used to store data in JavaScript.
  - They are case sensitive

Types of Variables:
  - let: It is a block scope variable, which means it is only accessible within the block it is declared in. It can be reassigned.
  - const: It is also a block scope variable, but it cannot be reassigned. It is used for declaring constants.
  - var: It is a function scope variable, which means it is accessible throughout the function it is declared in. It can be reassigned.

Example Codes:
  <script>
    let name = "venkat"
    {
      let name = "durga"
      console.log(name);
      console.log(name);
      document.write(name, "<br>");
    }
    console.log(name)
    console.log(name)
    document.write(name)
  </script>

Dynamic Type Language:
  Two types:
    1. Primitive
    2. Non-Primitive data type

Primitive Data Type:
  - Predefined; we can store single values
  - Types:
    1. Numbers: integers, floats
    2. String: Stream of characters enclosed in quotes
      - single, double, backtick quotes
    3. Boolean: true or false
    4. Null: nothing
    5. Undefined: no value assigned

Example Codes:
  <script>
    let name = "venkat"
    console.log(name)
  </script>

  <script>
    let name = "venkat"
    console.log(typeof name);
    console.log(typeof 5);
    console.log(typeof true);
    console.log(typeof null);
  </script>

Arithmetic Operators:
  1. + : addition
  2. - : subtraction
  3. * : multiplication
  4. / : division
  5. % : modulus
  6. ** : exponentiation
  7. ++ : increment
  8. -- : decrement

Example Code:
  <script>
    let a = 10;
    let b = 5;
    document.write("Addition: " + (a + b) + "<br>");
    document.write("Subtraction: " + (a - b) + "<br>");
    document.write("Multiplication: " + (a * b) + "<br>");
    document.write("Division: " + (a / b) + "<br>");
    document.write("Modulus: " + (a % b) + "<br>");
    document.write("Exponentiation: " + (a ** b) + "<br>");
    document.write("Increment: " + (++a) + "<br>");
    document.write("Decrement: " + (--b) + "<br>");
  </script>

Logical Operators:
  1. && : and
  2. || : or
  3. ! : not
  4. == : equal to
  5. != : not equal to
  6. === : equal to and same type
  7. !== : not equal to and not same type
  8. > : greater than
  9. < : less than
  10. >= : greater than or equal to
  11. <= : less than or equal to

Example Code:
  <script>
    let a = 10;
    let b = 5;
    document.write("And: " + (a > 5 && b < 10) + "<br>");
    document.write("Or: " + (a > 5 || b < 5) + "<br>");
    document.write("Not: " + !true + "<br>");
    document.write("Equal to: " + (a == 10) + "<br>");
    document.write("Not equal to: " + (a != 5) + "<br>");
    document.write("Equal to and same type: " + (a === 10) + "<br>");
    document.write("Not equal to and not same type: " + (a !== '10') + "<br>");
    document.write("Greater than: " + (a > 5) + "<br>");
    document.write("Less than: " + (a < 15) + "<br>");
    document.write("Greater than or equal to: " + (a >= 10) + "<br>");
    document.write("Less than or equal to: " + (a <= 10) + "<br>");
  </script>
 ternary Operators
 1. ?: : ternary operator
 Example Code:
 <script>
        let a = 10;
        let b = 5;
        document.write("Ternary operator: " + (a > b ? "a is greater than "));
       document.write("b" : "a is less than or equal to b") + "<br>");
 </script>
       <script>
                let a = parseInt(prompt("give 'a' as input"));
                let b = parseInt(prompt("give 'b' as input"));
                document.write("Addition: " + (a + b) + "<br>");
                document.write("Subtraction: " + (a - b) + "<br>");
                document.write("Multiplication: " + (a * b) + "<br>");
                document.write("Division: " + (a / b) + "<br>");
                document.write("Modulus: " + (a % b) + "<br>");
                document.write("Exponentiation: " + (a ** b) + "<br>");
                document.write("Increment: " + (a++) + "<br>");
                document.write("Decrement: " + (b--) + "<br>");10
      </script>
Conditional Statments:
definition: conditional statements are used to execute a block of code if a certain condition is met.
1. if : if statement
2. else if : else if statement
3. else : else statement
Example Code:
<script>
let a = 10;
let b = 5;
if (a > b) {
  document.write("a is greater than b");
  } else {
    document.write("a is less than or equal to b");
    }
    </script>

```javascript

```
loops: block of code several times
1)for loops
2)while loops
3)do while loops
